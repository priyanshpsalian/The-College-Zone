### Problem we are trying to solve?

There are many websites and apps available today for publishing announcements such as Instagram, Facebook, etc. But they are not intended for this, as their primary job is to entertain us by share photos, and reels.


Many juniors ask their doubts on watsaap group which has capacity of only 250 members.How can all the juniors be on same group same goes for seniors.This leads to lack of connectivity and knowledge.


After sems get over the need of that sem’s book is no more . They can be sold to juniors but who will connect them with seniors. 


**Problems with the exisiting sytem?**

The current solutions assumes to have 2 platforms 

- Another, Many juniors ask their doubts on watsaap group which has capacity of only 250 members.How can all the juniors be on same group same goes for seniors.This leads to lack of connectivity and knowledge.

- There are many websites and apps available today for publishing event related announcements such as Instagram, Facebook, etc. But they are not intended for this, as their primary job is to entertain us by share photos, and reels.

- And another, after sems get over the need of that sem’s book is no more . They can be sold to juniors but who will connect them with seniors. 

I wanted to solve this issue by developing a website that solves each of the above problems efficiently.

### Market & User Research

- On market research, the products available found, are not college specific.
- On user research and feedback from students, UX of such platforms isn't upto the mark.
- Committee Heads wanted to bring their post on top of user's feed.
- Client wanted a scaled doubt solving platform.

That's where we come into picture.

## Architecture and Design

The tradeoff in a Passion: `Strive strive till you succeed`

But something that I am proud of is,I tried to follow ideal software development practices.

- Architecture
- Design
- Code
<br />

The presentation for College Zone can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c1aiarGRYCKzakMDGuvS1Ny7yLW4jqwd/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102697595023867264508&rtpof=true&sd=true).

### Architecture

- The architecture and workflow was built using [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) and it is freaking [brilliant](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw).
<br />
<!-- <img src="assets/images/Capture.PNG/architecture.svg" /> -->
<br />

### Design

- The designs were built using [Figma](figma.com) and were brought to life with [HBS](https://handlebarsjs.com/).
